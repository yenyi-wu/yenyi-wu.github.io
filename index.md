## About Me
I am a PhD candidate in the Hydrology Science program at the University of Wyoming and currently serve as president of the ASPRS UW student chapter. <br>
My academic and professional interests center on remote sensing, data science, geospatial analysis, hydrology, and climate change. I am passionate about exploring the intersections of these fields to address pressing environmental challenges and to advance our understanding of water resources in a changing climate.

## Dissertation Work
My PhD research investigates **how both climate and human activities influence urban flash flooding**. I focus on eight U.S. inland cities that have experienced the most severe flooding, selecting the specific HUC12 watersheds within these cities that have recorded the highest historical flood events. The figure below highlights the locations of these eight cities along with their corresponding study watersheds.

To achieve the research objectives, the workflow is organized into two main phases:

**Phase 1: Trend Analysis in Extreme Precipitation and Flash Flooding (1996â€“2023)**

1. **Monte Carlo Simulation**
   This step applies Monte Carlo methods to examine long-term trends in both the frequency and magnitude of extreme precipitation events. The simulation enables robust detection of shifts and variability in precipitation extremes over time.
2. **Attribution Analysis**
   The focus is on determining whether the likelihood of flash flooding has changed over the study period. By comparing the recent period (2010â€“2023) to an earlier baseline (1996â€“2009), the analysis quantifies any changes in flash flood occurrence and account for natural variability using bootstrapping.

After both steps are done, we assess possible links with observed precipitation trends.
