## About Me
I am a PhD candidate in the Hydrology Science program at the University of Wyoming and currently serve as president of the ASPRS UW student chapter. <br>
My academic and professional interests center on remote sensing, data science, geospatial analysis, hydrology, and climate change. I am passionate about exploring the intersections of these fields to address pressing environmental challenges and to advance our understanding of water resources in a changing climate.

## Dissertation Work
My PhD research investigates **how both climate and human activities influence urban flash flooding**. I focus on eight U.S. inland cities that have experienced the most severe flooding, selecting the specific HUC12 watersheds within these cities that have recorded the highest historical flood events. The figure below highlights the locations of these eight cities along with their corresponding study watersheds.

To answer the research question, I appled:
1. Monte Carlo Simulation to detect trends in the frequency and magnitude of extreme precipitation.
2. Attribution Analysis to see if flash flooding becomes more likely to happen in the recent period (2010-2023) compared to the past period (1996-2009).
